Yes, but what we're saying is between 75.I'm going to say this because you guys, the horns are starting to topple their phrases on the 81s. Yes, but their backgrounds before that. I got to feel that. That's why I asked you before, when do they come in? Well, they come in as a main thing of 81, but before they play background.Okay, so you want to cut the backgrounds out? If we're going to do what we just did, I think we have to, right? Unless you think they'll... I don't know. Well, it's going to have to because... Right. There are changes. Yeah, so... The backgrounds have changes. So let's lose the backgrounds and have them come into AVW.No, no, no, their backgrounds come in on 66. Yeah, he said, this is the best sound, have them come in on 80.

So Tony, why don't you play a G then? OK. Yeah. But he would like to do the 5-4 one more time, going into G. And how many times? How many times does G stay open? G, we keep it open, I think. I mean, essentially, we keep it open. There is.There's backgrounds and we say the first solo last time is backgrounds second solo last time if you have more than one solo You have to decide who's gonna play solo.

They need to do their room section part properly. Yeah. I have another question, Fritz, just conceptually. Yes. In the solos, right? Yeah.

You're right. That's.that microphone here? Well, especially in the solo section. Yeah. Yeah. Did you guys just stand up? Stand up if you can. I'm not sure what we do about that.

Can you turn up the saxophone? We're going to play.Maybe stand up. Yeah, the problem is just turning it up is going to be loud all the time. We just need to play together when you guys hold it.

Yeah, but my suggestion, Mark, is that we play it the first time, then you play the solo, and we play it the last time to transition into high. Ah, that's a good idea. Yeah, but I already do that. I play the melody at the end of my solo going into high. Uh-huh, yeah. And you don't want any saxes there. It doesn't matter, but you want me to cue you for that? Well, well. Because you can't mark it, since I'm going to play it over the solo, so I can let you know when I'm going to play the last note. OK. And then you play the melody again, and then you go into another high. Right. I'm going to solo and you're going to play. Yeah, so we do what I said. We do it the first time, and we play it the last time. OK. So they're not going to play the melody both times. I'm playing the melody twice going into my solo. You don't want them to play it with me the second time? No. OK.No, it's kind of giving a variety to the... Cool, cool. But you were playing it the last time again, right? Yes, I am. Okay. I played it three times. Yeah, so therefore the last time they will play with you again. Awesome. Is that okay for you? That's fine. Okay.Now, before we go there, some other people have the changes.
