I'm going to sing it. But I'm going to do it again. Just once. Because you can't do it like that. It doesn't make sense. You have to sing it. So, we start from the beginning. We start with the middle. With the rhythm of the tambor. Then we go to the middle. And then, Margarita says, my mambo, how good, how good. Then we go to the middle. Okay? So, you look with the belly.
