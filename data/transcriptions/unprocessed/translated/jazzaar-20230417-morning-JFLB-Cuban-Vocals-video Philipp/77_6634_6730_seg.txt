Perfect. One point, the line you sang before, you start unisono before the first line, you start with unisono and then you go in four voices. Ah, okay. No, no, you sang a line before. That's already two voices, right? Yes. So it's not really two voices, it's unisono again. Exactly, but definitely you split. So I heard several voices. In terms of tone, you all started unisono with a lot of energy. As soon as you went into harmony, we all listened very carefully. So the tone changed a lot when you went into harmony. Maybe do this line again and keep the energy when you sing in harmony. What is the energy? It's just a little bit of energy. From the beginning. Make it like that, do it with energy and then see how it feels with the band. But just so that this time with harmony, the energy is broken. What do you mean by this? What do you mean? What do you mean by the mood? Yes, just from the tone. The tone changed a lot when you went into harmony. And I just want to make sure that we don't lose the harmony.
