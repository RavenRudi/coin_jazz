What we have to be aware of, Mark, is that the trumpet, the clarinet, you are really in unison. And this time it was not, last time. The melody, you know. Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. You realize you didn't write the melody of my part, right? So all I'm doing is remembering how I wrote the song. So I'm not reading the music. So we can either play it like I'm playing it, or you can write it out for me. But I can't guess what they're putting together. No problem. I'm more than happy to play it with you. I just need to know what it is. Actually, he intended to not even you playing the melody.
