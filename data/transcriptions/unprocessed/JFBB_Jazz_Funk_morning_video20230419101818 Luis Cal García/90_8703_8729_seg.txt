No, no, no, background. It looked like you went go out, sorry. No, no, no. I was telling him not to play. Not to play? It's three times guitar there, right? No, it's three times guitar, yes. Did he say only behind the guitar background? I think what I remember is I have a six, that it's repeated six times, and the last time should be with the background. Last time of each solo, or just the very last time? Just the very last time.
