I'm coming in and surprise you! You're not coming in! Bye, Monday Saves! You son of a bitch! What are you doing? What are you doing? Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! I'm not wasting your time! Oh, sure, sure! Yeah, that was a good one. Yeah, yeah. We used to abuse the tourists and we used to have a good time. Yeah, yeah. We had lunch. You should have it by tomorrow, you know. I just have the easiest thing. I know. Yeah. Even for bad kids. I like it. Ha, ha, ha! Good one. Good one. I think right now I'm going to go to sleep. There's a mini-career at the end of the tour. And you're at least in the top three. So, uh... No, no, no. It's OK. I'm going to sleep.
