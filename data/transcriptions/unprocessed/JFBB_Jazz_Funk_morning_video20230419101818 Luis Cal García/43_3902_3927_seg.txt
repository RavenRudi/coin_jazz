that microphone here? Well, especially in the solo section. Yeah. Yeah. Did you guys just stand up? Stand up if you can. I'm not sure what we do about that. But we're not communicating at all during the solos. It's like a play along. So if we keep rehearsing this way, that's how it's going to sound on Friday. OK. And that's not OK. Can you turn up the saxophone? We're going to play.
