Can I help you with it? What's going on? It's like I have to play three different ideas and switch between them without any chords because I'm switching between chords as reeds, trumpets, and trombones. I play different lines of those and these are always different ideas so I always struggle with getting into the new idea. What's the notes in this phrase here?
