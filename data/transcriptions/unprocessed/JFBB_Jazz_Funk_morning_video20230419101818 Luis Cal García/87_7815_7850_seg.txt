We have something, so hold on. Here's the problem with every time, hold on. Every time I say something, you correct it. Be careful that you don't correct it a different from the chart. We have something else marked as swing. So when I say slow blues at 103 and you say no, it's a swing section, we have swing marked at 128. Yeah, it's just a few. Dude, just don't correct it if it's not necessary. What I said, I meant the slow, we couldn't confuse it. That's all. I meant what I said. I think it's a slow section, basically. That's what I already said. Stop correcting it. I'm happy. And then on 128 is melody.
