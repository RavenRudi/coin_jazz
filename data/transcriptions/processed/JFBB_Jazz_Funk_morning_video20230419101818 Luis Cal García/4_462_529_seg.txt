So I'm solving over letter H. Yeah. So that's going to be open. That's going to be open. But they have this pick up line to H, so we could play it in the first time. I just asked you that, and all you did was play a whole. Let's hear it from letter G, go on to letter H last time, please. OK. All right. Letter G, last time. Just so all the harms are clear, there's a mistake in the chart. It should have a third time bracket over that bar before H. Yes. Yeah. So add that third time bracket in, because I think that's what the confusion is. OK. Not right. Yes. So the sol is going three times. Well, also. And a third time. As of now, no. We can open it up. I just felt like, OK, let's go. Well, whatever you choose. You know, so. So the last Y is a third ending in G. Yeah, third or what. I would put in X ending. Because, well, it's like we don't know how many courses we're going to have with whom. OK, so it's the last ending. It's last ending, yes. For now. For now.
