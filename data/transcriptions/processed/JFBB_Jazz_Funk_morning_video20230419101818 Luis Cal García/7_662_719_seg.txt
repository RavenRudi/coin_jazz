What's on your chart? We have written two times. So play it two times. And then I solo it. OK. Do you play the pickup line every time you go to melody? Wah, wah. Absolutely. It's part of the melody. OK, so then we have to edit to the last. Yeah, but my suggestion, Mark, is that we play it the first time, then you play the solo, and we play it the last time to transition into high. Ah, that's a good idea. Yeah, but I already do that. I play the melody at the end of my solo going into high. Uh-huh, yeah. And you don't want any saxes there. It doesn't matter, but you want me to cue you for that? Well, well. Because you can't mark it, since I'm going to play it over the solo, so I can let you know when I'm going to play the last note. OK. And then you play the melody again, and then you go into another high. Right. I'm going to solo and you're going to play. Yeah, so we do what I said. We do it the first time, and we play it the last time. OK. So they're not going to play the melody both times. I'm playing the melody twice going into my solo. You don't want them to play it with me the second time? No. OK.
