I have to go to the other band this afternoon, so just continue like you did. One thing. It's not so important to sing and learn the parts the first time, but as soon as you start repeating a song, I would like to ask you to think about how we move to it. Just so that it is a bit practiced from the beginning. If you don't practice from the beginning, it will be even more difficult at the end of the week.
