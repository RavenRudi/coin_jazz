Okay, well what should the guitar part do better? Everything. Okay, I don't want to play. We have to wait 30 seconds, so while I'm gonna tell you a story. Me playing with Ray Brown and Jeff Keizer, and Ray Brown kept doing like this to Keizer every night. One night he'd go like this. Louder! Stronger! Swing harder! More intense! More blues! Every night. So while he was doing this, while we were playing, Keizer says, God damn it Ray! I'm playing better! I'm playing louder! Stronger! You know, faster! One night he says, Better Keizer! Better! Just play better! Laughter This sounds like a Horny Silver story. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna play better. Playing a Horny Silver Story
