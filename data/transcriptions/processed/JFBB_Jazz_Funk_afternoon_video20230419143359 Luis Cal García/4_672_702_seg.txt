You cut off like everybody when you start playing. No, no, no. I just cut him off. OK. And that's because I wanted you to hear what chord I was playing. Can you hear me? OK, so we'll talk about it later. But yeah, just him. I want him to stop playing and listen for a second. OK. I'll write it down for you. Don't worry. So all right, three times is fine. Yeah. Then I basically, the third time, I cue the background. That's for your side to go on.
