We're doing the recording in one session. We'll just pause it. Six mics. So we're actually recording it. Then we're setting one way for a singer. It's a singer. Yeah. OK. So all the rest that we would like, we would need to record ourselves. We have six channels. And I'm thinking about what to bring and how to bring them. I have two rooms.
