Even as you're just learning your part, for example, when she said the attitude of you are nothing, like that needs to be expressed with your body, the fact that you are feeling that this person is nothing. Like you can't be like, you are nothing.It's just not going to work. You have to be like, you are nothing. So as you're learning your parts, start to incorporate that character in you. Like, what are you going to look like? What's the facial expression you're going to use? What's the body? And then definitely also, OK, at which section are you doing more? Something like this? At which section can you actually step? Like, the halftime was a perfect moment where you're probably going to be stepping. So just start keeping it in the back of your mind, even as you're just learning the words and the parts. How are you performing this? That's the real question. I understand. Thank you. Thank you.
