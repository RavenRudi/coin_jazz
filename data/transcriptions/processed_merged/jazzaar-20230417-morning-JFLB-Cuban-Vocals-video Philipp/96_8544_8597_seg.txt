These sound a bit strange, a bitâ€¦ Jazz? Let's see. Be ready to sing loudly or calmly rapusing.Let's try with the pianissimo. Okay? Now you make it more clear. Ah yes. The intentionality is now pianissimo. Yes, yes. The technique, which basically starts with pianissimo in the bars between the vocals, so pa, do, da, do, da, ba, and then there is pianissimo, and then nothing is written for the last bar. So it could be that it is a crescendo that is not written in or that it is pianissimo. But in the bar between the vocal parts, it is pianissimo. Okay. Very good. Listen, it's a pianissimo.
