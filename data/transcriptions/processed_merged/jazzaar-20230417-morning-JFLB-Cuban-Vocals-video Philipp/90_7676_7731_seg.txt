So, at the end we have only one point. These points are all repeated. So it could be...more than four times, depending on, because section O is repeated, P is repeated, and then when the single coloration point comes, U, that is only after P and O, uh, O and P have happened, and it could be, are there also the cases that O and P are repeated? Yes, yes, I know, it's longer, so I have to improvise four times and then comes, yes, exactly, yes, exactly. But to do no one notices that. No no no, I know. No no no, more times, but we only do four times now, yes. So, we go through this coloration and then come or no, I don't know. They act in four times.
