Okay, then it goes straight through the chart. Let's do it. Basically you can decide what who is going to play solo who you'd like. Oh, okay, so Ray, I can solo 89. And Ray can play over 100.Let's do that for now. You can add some... Ray and Bart... Basically, right now that's the solo section, and then it goes to the changes, like in the second pillar.I'm going to go to the other room. So, we keep it open there. Alright, so maybe me and Luke can do some trading or something. Okay. I don't know.
