Is there more? Is the melody, everybody soft there? Everybody's soft. It's the soft instruments playing. It's a clarinet playing. It's with harmoniutes. So... OK. No, it's this line, interchanging lines. You're feeling like this, feeling that structure.So at the start of the cover, what's the dynamic? Does it count deep crescendo all the way to 4 bar, 4 bar 137? It's a mezzo forte basically and then you slow it in further down. I mean first you go up the way you did it and then at the last section you go down.
