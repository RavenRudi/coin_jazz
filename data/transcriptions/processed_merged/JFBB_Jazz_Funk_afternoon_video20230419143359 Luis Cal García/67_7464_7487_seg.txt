So when you said one, two, three, four, then I'm at the first bar of my music? No, then you are on the intro of the piano, two bars out. You should have two bars rest. Well, one bar and three beats, and then you come in. You're going to say the same thing. That's as soon as that piano comes in. It's four bars before you're on the beat. OK, so start one more time, but I won't be sparing you.
