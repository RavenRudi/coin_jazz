That's what we agreed yesterday. He's playing the first solo, you're playing the second one. Do you want the whole rhythm section cut out? So he played three times A, too? Yeah. Cool. All right. Great. That's fine. So then. OK. Three, one, 10.You cut off like everybody when you start playing. No, no, no. I just cut him off. OK. And that's because I wanted you to hear what chord I was playing. Can you hear me? OK, so we'll talk about it later. But yeah, just him. I want him to stop playing and listen for a second. OK. I'll write it down for you. Don't worry. So all right, three times is fine. Yeah. Then I basically, the third time, I cue the background. That's for your side to go on.Okay, time for you? Yeah, it's great. Alright, so we take your solar. How about just the third time? Yeah, that was... The last time with my solar. Okay, let's do that. Okay, right with backgrounds. 1, 2, 3.
