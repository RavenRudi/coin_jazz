Okay, I'm playing basically the arrangement on MIDI, the way it's been written. Good as I have electric guitar too, woo hoo!There are some differences, yeah? No, not on the notes wise, but just maybe the form wise. Is it the same form? It's pretty much the same form, yes. But I want them to hear basically.
