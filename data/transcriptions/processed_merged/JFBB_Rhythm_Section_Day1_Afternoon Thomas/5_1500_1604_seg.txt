But you started, you started basically- So you gotta stop counting bars, once we start playing it, and just wait. And we'll cue you to bring in 81. So it's just gonna get, it's gonna-Mars, praise. Yeah. Yeah, so it's just, that's what I, yeah, I just meant like. But 81, I'm not sure whether we are talking the same spot. You said the horns come in at 81. The horns come full and they actually played it right. You know, they. Yes, but what we're saying is between 75.I'm going to say this because you guys, the horns are starting to topple their phrases on the 81s. Yes, but their backgrounds before that. I got to feel that. That's why I asked you before, when do they come in? Well, they come in as a main thing of 81, but before they play background.Okay, so you want to cut the backgrounds out? If we're going to do what we just did, I think we have to, right? Unless you think they'll... I don't know. Well, it's going to have to because... Right. There are changes. Yeah, so... The backgrounds have changes. So let's lose the backgrounds and have them come into AVW.No, no, no, their backgrounds come in on 66. Yeah, he said, this is the best sound, have them come in on 80. Which, maybe we need to hear them too, just kind of, yeah. Yeah, yeah. All together. Yeah. Because you know what it all sounds like, and I don't. Yeah. So I'm over here making up shit. You know what? The best is actually to really.
