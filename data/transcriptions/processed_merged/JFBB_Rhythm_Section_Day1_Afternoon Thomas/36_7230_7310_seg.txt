Or we can open it up. But I know none of the horns, mask of layout, have changes except Tony.Tony has changes, right? I've changed it. Yeah. What? He's changing which section? G. G. Yeah. So Tony, why don't you play a G then? OK. Yeah. But he would like to do the 5-4 one more time, going into G. And how many times? How many times does G stay open? G, we keep it open, I think.

We don't have to do that today So we do first a tenor solo and then a guitar solo
