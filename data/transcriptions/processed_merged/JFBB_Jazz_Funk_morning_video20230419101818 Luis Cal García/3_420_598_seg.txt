be an E flat minor chord. No, no, it should be that chord. That didn't just happen. Yeah, sure, because some people look at the second ending.

So the sol is going three times. Well, also. And a third time. As of now, no. We can open it up. I just felt like, OK, let's go. Well, whatever you choose. You know, so. So the last Y is a third ending in G. Yeah, third or what. I would put in X ending. Because, well, it's like we don't know how many courses we're going to have with whom. OK, so it's the.
