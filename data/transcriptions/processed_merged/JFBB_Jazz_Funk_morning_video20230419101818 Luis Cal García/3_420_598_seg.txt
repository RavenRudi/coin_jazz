be an E flat minor chord. No, no, it should be that chord. That didn't just happen. Yeah, sure, because some people look at the second ending. As long as we're clear, let's take it from G and get through that so I can hear what it's, you know, you're through. You mean background. Yeah, but let's be, so we, before we go on, on letter H, that melody that comes in, you want, you're playing solo, right? Yes, sir. Okay, so that pickup line will be a background line which I will cue. Or do you want to have the solo start with that line and then you develop and we go on into I.So I'm solving over letter H. Yeah. So that's going to be open. That's going to be open. But they have this pick up line to H, so we could play it in the first time. I just asked you that, and all you did was play a whole. Let's hear it from letter G, go on to letter H last time, please. OK. All right. Letter G, last time. Just so all the harms are clear, there's a mistake in the chart. It should have a third time bracket over that bar before H. Yes. Yeah. So add that third time bracket in, because I think that's what the confusion is. OK. Not right. Yes. So the sol is going three times. Well, also. And a third time. As of now, no. We can open it up. I just felt like, OK, let's go. Well, whatever you choose. You know, so. So the last Y is a third ending in G. Yeah, third or what. I would put in X ending. Because, well, it's like we don't know how many courses we're going to have with whom. OK, so it's the last ending. It's last ending, yes. For now. For now.And then the melody in H, do we play together with Mark? Or he plays a solo there? He's going to play solo there. But he wants to hear right now what you guys do. So we'll go first time, I think. And then it's over for solo. Yeah, we're going to use Nicola. Nicola. Yes? So there's a melody that happens before your solo starts. My solo? That's right. Did you say you want a solo? No, no, no. If we play melody together. That's what I asked. Or you play solo there. No, he doesn't play the melody. OK. You guys. OK. OK. What songs did you ask me about soloing?Can you say that again? What song was it that you asked me about soloing on? Wasn't it this? No, no, that was Bounce, I think. Oh, Bounce! OK, right. All right, cool. That was yesterday. Yeah. I know, but I'm pretty sure what you do there was yesterday. Yeah. Listen, bro. You're talking to me clearly and shit, so I just need help. Yeah, we all do. Not probably. OK. Letter G for the last time. Going into the last time ending. Then he wants to hear letter H. Here we go.
