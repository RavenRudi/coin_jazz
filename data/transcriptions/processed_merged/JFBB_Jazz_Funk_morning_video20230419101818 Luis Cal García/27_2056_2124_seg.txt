What exactly, I can't hear. Cut it out, cut it out. Whoa, whoa. Or practice it or whatever. Whoa, whoa, whoa. So the conclusion about the guitar is you go out to shed it and learn the lines. Cut it out. Everybody's gonna learn their part, and you'll be all right.Everything in a joke, man. So like, you look and learn the part. But he's not ready yet. So we went, oh, OK, but everybody's part is difficult. That shit, he just played with two octaves above everybody else. You can learn it or don't. But you should see my routine. I wrote it, shit. I know it's difficult. I wrote it. What I'm saying is, let's just learn. You want to do it slowly? Cool. Let's do it slowly. Nah, it's not going to help now. OK. No, no, no, no, no. Definitely, no. All right. But that's what's happening with it. We're going to figure it out later. All right. All right. Thank you, sir. No problem. OK.
