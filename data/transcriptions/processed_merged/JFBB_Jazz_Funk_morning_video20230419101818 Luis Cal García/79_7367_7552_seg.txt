It was good. Wow. That's really good. Okay. So, Filip, you think you want to play only one chorus? Yeah, I think so. Anyone else? I think me too, yes. Okay. That makes it very complex now. I think one more. I think the suggestion, yes, those backgrounds at like 51 and all that, I don't think they add anything. I think nobody should play until 67. No, no, well, yeah, it's hard to play as in... You know, just because it's grooving along so nicely and then we start playing these kind of very sparse, quiet backings, it just doesn't add anything. Yeah, but it's still a solo. What's that? It's still a solo. Where are you talking? No, I understand. I'm talking about the backings we have at 51. What 51? 51. We've got these like little... It just doesn't add anything. You know, because it's such a great groove that's going on and there's a great keyboard solo happening. For me, it just kind of drags it down a little bit.Yeah, I know, but the sections are already in the chart, so... You want to cut the trumpets out, and then you want to... All I'm saying is, for me, just for me, just a minute, I just don't think any of those backings added anything to the chart. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Almost like took away... But it's a cue, it's a key to go on. I keep them. Eh? I'll keep them. Yeah. It's just a minute. Yeah. Wow. So how many solos now? Is four solos each one now? Yeah, that's the question that I want to discuss. You know, you want more than one chorus? Or everybody wants to take just one chorus. And then maybe Ray takes two. Yeah. One with backgrounds. That's cool. Okay. Yeah, okay. So, one, and Ray takes two. And everything makes sense. Yeah.I don't want to hurt you. I don't want to hurt you. I will keep you right. It's basically the guitar playing the theme again. It starts in 131 actually. Is there any background there? There is the bari that's not here. And there is the guitar theme, which nobody can hear right now. Did you play? I played, yeah. Yeah, okay. You need to move up a little bit because it's really you. You're the only one playing it. All right. Can we restart here? Yeah. Or 131? Where is it? Yeah, 131 is perfect. It's good. All right. Okay, here we go. One, two, one, two, three, four.
