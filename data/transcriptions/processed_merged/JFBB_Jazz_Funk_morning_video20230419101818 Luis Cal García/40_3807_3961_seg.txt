127. So are we going to play that? 127 is back into halftime basically. to halftime basically.That's what I was thinking. Yeah, exactly. So what do we do, Fritz? I think let's do the last chorus of piano solo to get the trance. So we did play all that stuff. Yeah. No, no, no. Everybody did it. We heard that. They need to do their room section part properly. Yeah. I have another question, Fritz, just conceptually. Yes. In the solos, right? Yeah. When we're going from soloist to soloist, we need to do something to sort of finish one solo and start the next. Yeah, it's kind of the background of the whole instrument. No, no, no, no, not you and your room. Just as musicians. The rhythm section you're talking about. Yeah, I think we need to just.So yeah, so I was playing as opposed to the notes, right? Yes. That's what you need to orchestrate. Yeah, yeah. We need to actually interpret the end of the solo. What would help, though? I don't know if you can hear, but I can't hear the soloist in the monitor. You're right. That's.that microphone here? Well, especially in the solo section. Yeah. Yeah. Did you guys just stand up? Stand up if you can. I'm not sure what we do about that. But we're not communicating at all during the solos. It's like a play along. So if we keep rehearsing this way, that's how it's going to sound on Friday. OK. And that's not OK. Can you turn up the saxophone? We're going to play.Maybe stand up. Yeah, the problem is just turning it up is going to be loud all the time. We just need to play together when you guys hold it. Yeah, okay.You want to do the whole solo section? That'd be wonderful, yeah. Okay. So, let's start right in 91. 91 with tenor.
