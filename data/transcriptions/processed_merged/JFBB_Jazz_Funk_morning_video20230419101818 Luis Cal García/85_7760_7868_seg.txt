And who else? You have four times. I have four times. Okay, four times. Remember my solo was at 103, right? You have yours on 103, yes.Yeah, that is the swing, slow swing section. No, the swing section is at 128 minus in the slow blues section. Okay. Thanks.We have something, so hold on. Here's the problem with every time, hold on. Every time I say something, you correct it. Be careful that you don't correct it a different from the chart. We have something else marked as swing. So when I say slow blues at 103 and you say no, it's a swing section, we have swing marked at 128. Yeah, it's just a few. Dude, just don't correct it if it's not necessary. What I said, I meant the slow, we couldn't confuse it. That's all. I meant what I said. I think it's a slow section, basically. That's what I already said. Stop correcting it. I'm happy. And then on 128 is melody.and the original tempo, and it has this three bar halftime, and it goes back up in 120 into the fast ending. And then watch the Victor down below.
